Make a game where you start in a single screen. When you complete that screen,
you get a code. Share this code on social media. The code can be used twice.
When someone else uses that code, the game generates a new level just for them
and adds it to your game (so now you have two screens to play in). Each person
must therefore continue to complete the available screens and share them in
order to keep playing, thereby _growing_ the available game space, total number
of players, and total time played.

Stretch goals: have players meet up with each other, so they're all basically
part of a shared world.

# what do you do on a screen?

- Zelda-esque single dungeon room with enemies, a key, and a door.
- Talk to shopkeeper and buy equipment
- ???
